Highlight
================

Highlight is a client-side syntax highlighter for R code. 

Unlike most syntax highlighters, comments, strings and parentheses are emphasised and 
other elements are played down. The assumption is that most programmers are competent
enought to spot numbers and boolean values, so colouring is best spent 
outlining the structure and documentation of a program.
