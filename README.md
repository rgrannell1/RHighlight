Highlight
================

Highlight (renamed from 'prism' for unfortunate reasons) is a syntax highlighter for R
code. 

Unlike most syntax highlighters, comments, strings and parentheses are emphasised and 
other elements are played down. The assumption is that most programmers are competent
enought to spot numbers and boolean values, so colouring is best spent 
outlining the structure and documentation of a program. 

Highlight uses rainbow parentheses (of LISP fame, but R will one layer of 
brackets from being LISP), and highlights quotes inside strings to make 
nested strings humanly possible to read.
